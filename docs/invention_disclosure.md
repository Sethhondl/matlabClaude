# Invention Disclosure: Derivux for MATLAB

## 1. Administrative Information

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Title** | Derivux for MATLAB: Workspace-Aware AI Integration with Secure Code Execution |
| **Inventor** | Sebastian Hondl |
| **Date of Conception** | January 15, 2026 |
| **Status** | Working Prototype (Private Repository) |
| **Prior Public Disclosure** | None |

### University Affiliation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Institution** | University of Minnesota |
| **Department** | Mechanical Engineering |
| **Development Context** | Personal project, not university research |

### Independent Development Declaration

This invention was developed **independently** using:
- Personal computer and personal time
- Skills from coursework (not research assistantship)
- University-provided MATLAB license (standard student resource, available to all enrolled students)

**Not used:** Research funding, lab facilities, research staff, faculty collaboration, specialized equipment.

The MATLAB license is a standard educational resource (like library access or campus WiFi), distinct from research-specific resources that might trigger university IP claims.

## 2. Summary of Invention

**Derivux** integrates Claude AI into MATLAB/Simulink with:

1. **Workspace Awareness** — AI sees live variables, types, and values
2. **Secure Execution** — Sandbox blocks dangerous operations before running AI-generated code
3. **Simulink Manipulation** — Programmatic model creation, modification, and layout optimization
4. **Visual Capture** — Plots and diagrams displayed inline in chat
5. **Multi-Session Isolation** — Independent contexts per chat tab
6. **Agent Routing** — Pattern-based routing to specialized agents

## 4. Novel Claims

### Claim 1: Bidirectional Async Communication Bridge
Persistent Python event loop maintains AI client state across MATLAB's synchronous calls, enabling conversation memory without process spawning.
- **Ref:** `python/derivux/bridge.py:124-186`

### Claim 2: Real-Time Workspace Introspection
Type-aware extraction of MATLAB workspace state, formatted for AI context with size-based truncation and priority ordering.
- **Ref:** `toolbox/+derivux/WorkspaceContextProvider.m:31-85`

### Claim 3: Security-Sandboxed Code Execution
Domain-specific blocklist (system calls, eval chains, shell escapes) validates AI-generated code before execution, with configurable modes (prompt/auto/bypass).
- **Ref:** `toolbox/+derivux/CodeExecutor.m:21-27, 111-175`

### Claim 4: Simulink Layout Algorithm
Five-phase graph layout (extraction → layer assignment → crossing minimization → coordinate assignment → wire routing) producing publication-quality diagrams.
- **Ref:** `toolbox/+derivux/SimulinkLayoutEngine.m` (807 lines)

### Claim 5: Multi-Session Context Isolation
Per-tab conversation contexts within single process, with session switching that preserves state.
- **Ref:** `python/derivux/bridge.py:1414-1516`

### Claim 6: Pattern-Based Agent Routing
Confidence scoring routes requests to specialized agents via explicit commands or keyword detection.
- **Ref:** `python/derivux/agents/specialized_agent.py:61-96`
